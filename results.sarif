This leads to authorization by-pass. Authorization, or access control, is a way of mediating access to resources and application functionality based on the identity of a user. Anytime a user can gain access to a resource that is denied to their role, they have performed authorization bypass. There are countless ways authorization bypass can occur. In this case, the user is able to execute a Read, Update, or Delete (CRUD) function in Apex code without their permission being validated correctly.
